![text](https://i.imgur.com/DQu6N7O.png)


The Archiwebos agency where I work asked me to join a team as a front-end developer in order to help them in the realization of their project: **The design of an interior designer's portfolio website**.



After the team meeting, **3 main missions** were given to me.
I have to develop:

* **The presentation page of the architect's work** (from the HTML provided) ;
* **The login page of the site administrator** (the client) (code to be created from scratch);
* **The modal allowing to upload new media** (code to create from scratch).

--------------------

##  **Projet Composition :**
--------------------
* **The Figma of the design**. 
* **The back-end code**. 
* **The original front-end code with the static version of the architect's page**.
* **The Kanban for the mission**.
